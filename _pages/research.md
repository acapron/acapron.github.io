<b>"Overreaction in Football Wagers"</b> with Gary Smith (Pomona), Big Data, 2018, 6(4): 262-270.

</summary>
  

<ul><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Abstract:</span> Football scores are an imperfect measure of a team's ability, and consequently exaggerate differences in abilities. Those teams that perform the best and the worst are not really so far from average in their ability; thus their future performances regress to the mean. Betting data indicate that gamblers do not fully account for this regression.</ul>

<b><a href="/files/CHHL_InsiderCEOs.pdf">"Insider CEOs: Lucky or Good?"</a></b> with Barton Hamilton (WashU), Andrés Hincapié (UNC), and Noah Lyman (Warwick), <i>submitted</i>.

</summary>
  

<ul><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Abstract:</span> Why do firms tend to hire CEOs from within rather than externally? And why do
external hires increase when firm performance is poor? We answer these questions using a dynamic selection model of CEO hiring and turnover, weighing the relative importance of various
mechanisms suggested in the literature including differences in average quality, uncertainty about
CEO quality, costs of firing, preference for internal hires, and preference for “rocking the boat”
(external hires) during times of crisis. Firm performance is persistent and boards learn about CEO
quality over time, facing different levels of uncertainty when hiring internally or externally. We
estimate the model using a matched CEO-firm panel from 1995-2019 of all publicly-traded North
American firms. We find that the main mechanism answering these questions is information. Our
estimates indicate that boards’ uncertainty over insider candidates is roughly half that of outsiders,
which causes insider CEOs to become better selected and generates a significant difference in quality ex-post despite there being little ex-ante difference in quality between the two candidate pools.
Long-tenured insider CEOs thus tend to be “good” while outsiders tend to be “lucky.” Finally,
the higher variation in quality faced by firms when hiring externally increases firms’ willingness
to hire outsiders when performance is poor, in hopes of drawing an exceptional outsider from the
right tail of the distribution.</ul>
