<b>"Overreaction in Football Wagers"</b> with Gary Smith (Pomona), Big Data, 2018, 6(4): 262-270.

</summary>
  

<ul><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Abstract:</span> Football scores are an imperfect measure of a team's ability, and consequently exaggerate differences in abilities. Those teams that perform the best and the worst are not really so far from average in their ability; thus their future performances regress to the mean. Betting data indicate that gamblers do not fully account for this regression.</ul>

<b><a href="/files/CHHL_InsiderCEOs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Insider CEOs: Lucky or Good?"</a></b> with Barton Hamilton (WashU), Andrés Hincapié (UNC), and Noah Lyman (Warwick), <i>submitted</i>.

</summary>
  
<ul><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Abstract:</span> Why do internally promoted CEOs outperform external hires? We answer this question
using a dynamic selection model of CEO hiring and turnover. Firm performance is persistent
and boards gradually learn about CEO quality, facing different uncertainty when hiring internally
or externally. We estimate the model using a matched CEO-firm panel (1995-2019) of S&P 1500
firms. After accounting for endogenous turnover, performance, and hiring decisions, the key mechanism
generating the performance gap is information. Boards’ uncertainty over insider candidates
is roughly half that of outsiders, resulting in better selected insider CEOs and a significant difference
in executive quality ex-post, despite little ex-ante difference between insiders and outsider
candidates. Hence, long-tenured insider CEOs tend to be “good” while outsiders tend to be
“lucky.” Overall, our results show that information, not innate ability, explains insiders’ superior
performance, and that firm size magnifies this informational advantage.</ul>

<b>"Dynamic Treatment Choices and Selection into RCTs: Evidence from Prostate Cancer"</b> with Barton Hamilton (WashU), Brian McManus (UNC), Juan Pantano (UHK), and Justin Trogdon (UNC-Gillings). 

</summary>

<ul><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Abstract:</span> We study the design and interpretation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that
compare medical treatments already in wide use. These RCTs often compare treatments that vary in their curative effectiveness and side effects, plus they can involve
dynamic decisions by patients about when to switch to a more aggressive treatment.
Although the goal of RCTs is often an estimate of the population average treatment effect (ATE), the above factors induce patient selection into RCTs that generates estimates of a volunteer average treatment effect (VATE) different from the ATE. We demonstrate how to address these issues using a dynamic decision model and empirical
methods that combine population and RCT data. We apply our method to treatment strategies for prostate cancer.</ul>
